## Ansible Code for test deployments

## Special Notes

* Other than the database, address space assumes only a single type of node per installation, so the addressing is inherently simpler

* Database passwords do not meet MySQL requirements.  This is done on purpose so that you are forced to change them.  Do not file PR's to "fix" this.
